      <description>IntroductionThe other day, a question was posted on RStudio Community about performing Principle Component Analysis (PCA) in a tidyverse workflow. Conveniently, I had literally just worked through this process the day before and was able to post an answer. While most questions and answers are good as they are on forum sites, I thought this one might be worth exploring a little more since using the tidyverse framework makes PCA much easier, in my opinion.</description>

      <description>IntroductionRecently, I have been building shiny apps for work. The app that I am currently working on is an interface to a database for storing information about laboratory samples being collected. In addition to building the shiny app for my coworkers to interact with the database, I also was tasked with creating and building the database. I have never build a SQL database from scratch, but luckily the odbc and the DBI packages make it fairly straight foreward.</description>
