      <description>IntroductionI am happy to share a fun project I put together this weekend - a new R package called dundermifflin. If you canâ€™t guess from the name, it will give you quotes from the Office whenever you want! This package was inspired by the goodshirt package, which gives users quotes from The Good Place, I was able to great a similar package for the Office. By using theOffice-api, I created a data set, office_quotes, that is shipped with the package, that has every line from the Office, with the exception of season 5.</description>
