      <description>I am pleased to announce that my manuscript entitled &amp;ldquo;Using Historical LCR and Water Quality Data to Evaluate Corrosion Control Treatment - A Case Study&amp;rdquo; has been published in the upcoming issue of Journal - American Water Works Association (JAWWA Octobor 2018). This article explores the utility of historical LCR and water quality data to assess a drinking water distribution system&amp;rsquo;s corrosion control treatment progress.
I would like to thank my co-author, Nicola Horscroft, who is the lead Project Engineer for the LCR sampling program for the Philadelphia Water Department (PWD).</description>
