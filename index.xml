      <description>My Name is Tyler Bradley and I am Environmental Engineer for the Philadelphia Water Department. I work mostly with drinking water distribution system water quality data. Most of my day to day work is focused on data science. I am a PhD student at Drexel University studying Environmental Engineering, more specifically using data science to solve distribution system water quality issues. I am huge fan of R and the tidyverse and all that it includes.</description>
